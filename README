NAME
    App::Pod2CpanHtml - Convert Pod to search.cpan.org style HTML.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used for converting Pod documents to search.cpan.org
    style HTML.

    Pod is Perl's "Plain Old Documentation" format, see perlpod.

    "App::Pod2CpanHtml" produces HTML output similar to search.cpan.org by
    using the same conversion module, Pod::Simple::HTML and the same CSS,
    http://search.cpan.org/s/style.css.

    It should be noted that this utility isn't the actual program used to
    create the HTML for seach.cpan.org. However, the output should visually
    be the same.

    This module comes with a pod2cpanhtml utility that will convert Pod to
    search.cpan.org style HTML on the command line.

        pod2cpanhtml file.pod > file.html

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

    	perl Makefile.PL
    	make
    	make test
    	make install
