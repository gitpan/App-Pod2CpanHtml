NAME
    App::Pod2CpanHtml - Convert Pod to search.cpan.org style HTML.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used for converting Pod documents to
    http://search.cpan.org style HTML.

    Pod is Perl's "Plain Old Documentation" format, see perlpod.

    "App::Pod2CpanHtml" produces HTML output similar to search.cpan.org by
    using the same conversion module, Pod::Simple::HTML and the same CSS,
    http://search.cpan.org/s/style.css.

    It should be noted, however, that this isn't the actual module that is
    used to create the HTML for seach.cpan.org; that source code isn't
    currently in the public domain. As such the HTML may not be identical
    but in most cases it will be quite close and visually it should be the
    same.

    This module comes with a pod2cpanhtml utility that will convert Pod to
    search.cpan.org style HTML on the command line.

        pod2cpanhtml file.pod > file.html

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

    	perl Makefile.PL
    	make
    	make test
    	make install
